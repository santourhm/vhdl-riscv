This project presents a complete VHDL implementation of a 4-stage pipelined CPU based on the RISC-V architecture. The pipeline includes the four classic stages: FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE, and WRITE BACK. Each stage has been designed and connected to ensure correct instruction flow and data handling. The CPU supports a subset of the RV32I instruction set and demonstrates basic hazard management and control signal generation. The design has been fully simulated and verified using GHDL, and signal waveforms were analyzed with GTKWave to validate the pipeline behavior and instruction execution. This project aims to provide a clear and educational example of how a simple RISC-V processor can be implemented in VHDL and tested in a simulation environment.
